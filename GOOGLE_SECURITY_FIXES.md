# Google Security Warning Fixes - UPDATED

## Issue
Google Search Console detected "Social engineering content" on https://zantaku.com, flagging the site as potentially harmful to users.

**Google's Warning:** "These pages attempt to trick users into doing something dangerous, such as installing unwanted software or revealing personal information."

## Root Causes Identified
